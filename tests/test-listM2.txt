Milestone2 tests 

Provided tests:  All tests run leak santizer at the end. 
0. All tests from milestone1 
1. Declare a single variable 
2. Echo variable value matches expected value 
3. Can declare and access 100 variables successfully 
4. Multi-line accesses. E.g. echo $var1 $var2 $var3 
5. Declaration is similar to bash. E.g. myvar = hello fails (spaces!)
6. "echo $ a" still displays $ a, i.e. a is not treated as a variable. 
7. Memory leaks 
8. Redefining variables works for 1 variable. 

Edge cases (not provided):
1. Variable declaration line cannot exceed 64 characters 
2. Redefining variables works for 100 variables.
3. Fail gracefully on malloc
